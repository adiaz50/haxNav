The user may choose whether to provide his/her email address.

If additional personal information is collected, the user is provided with guidelines on the ‘collected personal information, the purpose of collecting and using personal information, and the personal information storage period’ and is asked whether the user agrees to the collection and use of the information.

<b>The IP address, cookies, service usage records, device information, and location information may be generated and collected during service use. Also, for search services, etc. using images or voice data, images or voice data may be collected.</b>

<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">[Additional explanation on the collection of generated information] </span>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">
What is an IP (Internet Protocol) address?</span>
An IP address is the online address information assigned by Internet service providers to devices such as PCs used to connect to the Internet. There are diverse opinions in each country regarding whether IP addresses constitute personal information.

<span style="font-weight: bold;">
What is service usage history?</span>
Service usage history refers to all records, including the date and time of accessing NAVER, the list of services used, and any normal or abnormal logs generated during the use of services. It also includes the email addresses recorded during the process of sending and receiving emails, phone numbers entered when inviting friends or giving gifts, and conversation histories between sellers and buyers on Smart Store (NAVER Talk Talk and Product Q&A posts).

<span style="font-weight: bold;">
What is device information?</span>
The device information mentioned in this privacy policy includes all information that can be confirmed through the S/W used for the operation of the device, in addition to the information assigned to the device during the manufacturing and sales process. This includes information such as the computer's name assigned by the user during the OS (Windows, Mac OS, etc.) installation process, serial numbers of peripheral devices attached to the PC, unique identification values required for communication on smartphones (IMEI, IMSI), AAID or IDFA, language settings, standard time settings, and the mobile carrier code of the USIM. However, when NAVER needs to collect a unique identification value of the device, such as IMEI, NAVER encrypts it to remove the identifiability before collecting it.

<span style="font-weight: bold;">
What is a cookie?</span>
A cookie is a very small text file that a website stores on a user's PC through the user's web browser when the user accesses the website. When the user visits the website again, the website server reads the stored cookie on the user's PC to maintain the user's preferred service settings for a convenient internet service experience. In addition, it allows the provision of specialized services (including advertisements) tailored to the user's preferences and interests by analyzing information such as visited service details, service access time and frequency, and information generated or provided (input) during service usage. Users can choose to allow all cookies, receive confirmation for each cookie's storage, or refuse the storage of all cookies by configuring the options in their web browser. However, rejecting cookie storage may cause inconvenience in using some NAVER services that require login.
